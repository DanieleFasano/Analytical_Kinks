Analytical_Kinks contains:

ChannelMaps.py -- computes planet-induced nonlinear velocity and density perturbations, produces channel maps figures
                  and saves them as CM_NoPlanet.png, CM_PlanetNoVisc.png, CM_PlanetVisc.png
Functions.py -- contains definitions of functions used by ChannelMaps.py
X_final.dat, Y_final.dat, utot_final.dat, vtot_final.dat, ky12.0x2.dat  -- contain data concerning the linear perturbations
CM_NoPlanet.png, CM_PlanetNoVisc.png, CM_PlanetVisc.png -- a preview of the output figures



Usage:

Run "python ChannelMaps.py" on your terminal, in the directory Analytical_Kinks.
(I recommend python version >= 3.8)



WARNING: During the next few days I am going to make many many changes in order to make the code more readable, easier to use
and hopefully a bit more efficient. I will also provide soon the script that computes the linear density and velocity
perturbations.
